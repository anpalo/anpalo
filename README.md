**Hi, I'm Andrew Lockdall** <br>
I enjoy solving problems—whether it's debugging and optimizing some of my own gnarly nested for-loops, cracking a LeetCode puzzle, or negotiating peace talks between two of my first-grade students locked in a furious debate over who would win in a fight between turtles and snails (I've yet to solve this one). I still have a lot to learn!

🖥️ Working primarily with Python since 2021  
🐹 Currently learning Go and SQL  
🏗️ Recent projects include:
* Building a static site generator with Markdown to HTML conversion, regex text parsing, and node-based architecture  
* Developing a book API with Flask and PostgreSQL <br>

🚀 Can easily spend many joyful hours on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/arrelecq/) <br>
🏁 Play me in chess on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/daristane) - I'm not that good, but I try. <br>
Go Pacers.
