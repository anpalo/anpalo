**Hi, I'm Andrew Lockdall** <br>
I like solving problems, whether it's debugging my own gnarly nested for-loops, cracking LeetCode puzzles, or negotiating peace talks between two 1st graders students arguing about erasers.

- Working primarily with Python since 2021  
- Currently working (and learning) with Go on my Budget Dashboard project
  
🏗️ My recent projects include:
* Building a static site generator with Markdown to HTML conversion, regex text parsing, and node-based architecture  
* Developing a book API with Flask and PostgreSQL <br>

 I can spend countless happy hours on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/arrelecq/) .<br>
🏁 Play me in chess on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/daristane) - I'm not that good, but I try. <br>

Go Pacers.
